# The COVID-19 News Bot on Telegram
----------

## Why do we make this COVID-19 news bot?
Since WHO announced COVID-19 a global pandemic, people all around the world have started focusing on everything about the coronavirus. Other than the urge of crawling online social network for local news, we just cannot help trying to learn how other countries are doing, despite the language barrier. 

How did the Korean implement their drive-thru coronavirus testing sites in 2 days? What did the Japanese do to keep upcoming Olympic games running? Are there really no increased confirmed cases in China right now? -- It is hard to seek and find the news and messages related to this specific topic on a real-time basis, especially when you do not understand the languages.

We make this COVID-19 news bot to translate news headlines and SNS messages to your language, so you can keep up-to-date news about what are going on in the world. You can either subscribe our channel or become a contributor to this bot.

## How does this COVID-19 news bot work?

* We have a telegram channel publishing latest news and valuable social media posts about COVID-19, with a bot translating them into different languages.

* A group of volunteers from different background of native languages and cultures cooperate to provide news headlines and SNS messages to the bot.

* The bot translates the original texts it receives, and translates them into different languages for publishing in the telegram channel automatically. 

* By subscribing the the Telegram channel, all users can read the news updates and will get a prompt after each pushed message, to score the quality of translation and to improve the translation.

* The suggestions of improvement can eventually be used to train a better machine learning model that would provide more accurate translation.

* Anyone can volunteer to join our contributors team and collect valuable and interesting posts or news headlines to the bot, and get them translated before pushing to the channel.


## Why do translations look bad on this bot and how to help improve it?

Simply because we lack of source of language corpora: when our bot had never learned what “coronavirus” means in other languages (well, most people including us just learned it in the past few months), it could not have translated the term correctly to other languages. Healthcare related corpora are greatly in need for this task, while most of the resources have been controlled by the tech giants.

If more text corpora in different languages are available, the translation bot would be able to do a better job in translation.  No matter you just subscribed to the channel or decided to join our contributors team, you could help make this bot better or even an expert in translation of this particular area.

A click on the score indicating the quality of the translation, if you knew both of the languages, would greatly help our bot!

What do we give back to the community?
Everything! We do not take any of the work from the community for keeping by ourselves. To the contrast, we open-source everything we have and the community contributes to this bot, our plan includes but not limited to the following:

* Source code of the telegram bot itself,
* Text corpora of languages we support,
* Source code processing the above text corpora,
* Machine learning model we made using the text corpora,
* Users contributed improvement to translated news and messages.

We hope by doing this work in a completely transparent manner, everyone can benefit from some parts of this project. 

No matter you want to learn about the latest coronavirus news and messages on SNS, start learning a foreign language by reading, take a try on machine learning translation models, or just make your own telegram bot, you are welcome to join us!
